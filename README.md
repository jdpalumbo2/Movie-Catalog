# Movie-Catalog

•	For this project I implemented a binary search tree that stores movies based on the year published and their rating.  
•	The application can add and remove movies from the tree, lookup movies based on keywords in their title, as well as finding a list of the best movies from a given year sorted by their rating.  
•	Three main objects were used: nodes, movies, and the movie tree itself. The movie tree object was structured after a BST while each of the nodes added represented an individual movie.
